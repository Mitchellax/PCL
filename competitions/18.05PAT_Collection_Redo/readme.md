This is a solutions collection of PAT Ladder Race.

To complete this collection must be a long-term aim because I am only a noob in programming. I will try my best.

I have done nearly all the L1 (level 1) questions in vacation 2018 but the coding style is too messy and I want to make it  better, so I will try to keep on certerned rules to coding.

rules below:

+ All codes editing with vim (for training);
+ Functions naming with Camel Case;
+ Classes naming with Camel Case;
+ Varables naming with Mixed Case;
+ Global varable naming with prefix ``G_``;
+ Static varable naming with prefix ``S_``;

Warning: This program have to pause for some time because the PAT is transporting to PTA (LOL) and these questions can not be seen in this period.
